# TicTacToe
My own version of the game TicTacToe, written in Javascript, displayed on a HTML canvas. Keeps track of the player scores and allows the player to reset the game and score. The file can be opened by any modern browser.

# Usage
The game can be run by simply dragging TicTacToe.html into your browser window with Javascript enabled.
Alternativaly you can just launch a HTTP server.

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

 The game can be played against a fairly compentent computer player or against a real human player on a pass and play principle.
